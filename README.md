# Statistics for Data Science

The basic statistical things to see first from a data set are:

Descriptive Statistics: This includes calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for continuous variables and frequency tables for categorical variables.

Distribution of the data: This includes checking the shape, central tendency, and variability of the data set. This can be done through visualizations like histograms and box plots.

Outliers: Checking for outliers in the data set and determining if they need to be handled or if they are valid values.

Missing values: Checking for missing values in the data set and determining how to handle them.

Correlation: Checking for correlations between variables in the data set.

Normality: Checking if the data is normally distributed.

Skewness: Checking if the data is skewed and in which direction.

Kurtosis: Checking if the data is peaked or flat.

Summary statistics: Getting a summary of the data set using techniques such as quantiles and percentiles.

These are the basic statistical things to see first from a data set to have a better understanding of the data.
